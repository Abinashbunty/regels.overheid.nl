## Pull request

You can also contribute by submitting a pull request. If you wish to do so find an issue in the issues list. For a more detailed description of contributing in this way see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/MinBZK/regels.overheid.nl/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md)

### CI

The pull request will be validating using Github Actions (see [.github/workflows](https://github.com/MinBZK/regels.overheid.nl/tree/develop/.github/workflows)). If you want to test the pr locally before submitting you can do so by running the scripts prefixed with `ci:` in the individual app repositories.
