# FLINT

## Norm engineering program

A TNO program that works on theoretical models for normative systems and their practical application, supported by prototypes for technical support based on open standards and open source software.

The basis of the program consists of a protocol for performing normative tasks (Calculemus) and an explicit normative language for recording interpretations of legal sources (Flint). Flint was developed to represent the application of norms in the social, ethical and legal domain in a way that makes norms understandable to humans, and suitable for automatic reasoning by machines.

The approach is action-oriented (norms are used to regulate behaviour) and focuses on describing the interpretation of the parties involved in a normative issue as explicitly as possible. Recognizing and resolving differences of opinion is an explicit part of the approach.

The method is used, among other things, to:

- develop practical legal frameworks for tailor-made services,
- understandable automatic decisions (incl. explainable AI),
- strengthening the legal position of citizens in administrative proceedings,
- enable knowledge exchange between organizations using different methods of representing and using standards and rules.

More detailed explanation can be found [here](../assets/docs/calculemus.pdf).

The Norm engineering program is part of the Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations spending plan 'Innovation in services', which was made as an elaboration of the government response to 'Unprecedented injustice'. Sequel to NL DIGIbeter innovation project Calculemus-Flint and OBDO innovation project Legal engineering.
